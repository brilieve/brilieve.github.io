      <article>
        <h3>My Past</h3>
          <p>I was born in Miami, Florida on March 26, 1994. At the age of 7, my family and I moved two hour away to Port Saint Lucie, FL where we still reside. In middle school, I loved science and wanted to become a doctor. However, once I entered highschool, I became more interested in math. </p>

        <h3>The Present</h3>
          <p>I currently attend the University of Miami double majoring in Accounting and Visual Journalism, with a focus on multimedia. I have always loved numbers, but I also love graphic design, hence my two very different majors. I dedicate most of my free time, outside of classes, to my extracirrculars and organizations. As a Resident Assitant, and leader of several organizations, I'm always on the go. </p>

        <h3>Looking to the Future</h3>
          <p>For the summer, I will be interning with Price Waterhouse Coopers and completing a service project in India with the student organization, Hyperion Council. I plan on taking the CPA Exam the summer after my senior year and go on to obtain my CPA license after finishing a MBA. Five years from now, I hope to work for a public accounting firm and have completed my MBA. My ultimate goal is to either start my own business or help other people start their own business.</p>
